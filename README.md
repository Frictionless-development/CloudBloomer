# CloudBloomer
cloudBloomer is a short piece of C++ code that uses openFrameworks* to do some manipulation of pointcloud data. 
 It works with one pointcloud file (the .txt file you created in textEdit from a .ply file). By setting
various parameters in the code, you can geometrically manipulate the pointcloud, causing it to (for example)
rotate or expand over time.
cloudBloomer produces output in two modes, ‘live; and ‘save’. In ‘live’ mode, it renders the manipulation in a
window on screen; in ‘save’ mode, it writes rendered frames as a sequence of images to disk (that you can
later import into DaVinci Resolve as a movie)
